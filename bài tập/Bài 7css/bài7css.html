        <h1>MH17 crash: Russia vetoes UN resolution for international tribunal</h1>
        <p id="newspaper">
            Russia has used its veto at the UN to block a draftresolution to set up aninternational tribunal into the
            MH17 air disaster inJuly 2014. It was the only nation at the 15-memberUN Security Council tooppose the
            move, triggering widespread condemnation.
            <br><br>The Malaysian Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur
            crashed in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board. Pro-Russian rebels in the area have denied
            shootingdown the aircraft. Western nations
            and Ukraine say there is evidence it was hitby a Russian-supplied Bukanti-aircraft missile - a claim also
            denied by Russia.'Callous disregard'
            <br><br>Malaysia pushed for an international tribunal to try those
            responsible. The move was backed by the Netherlands - which had 196 nationals on board -Ukraine, Belgium and
            Australia. Moscow has blamed the government in Kiev for the
            disaster.Eleven of the 15 UN Security Council members backed the draft resolution Speaking earlier this
            month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the establishment of atribunal would be "premature" and
            "counter-productive".
